Three Layer Architecture Project

# Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Three Layer Architecture in C#. The architecture consists of three main layers:

Presentation Layer (UI) – Handles user interactions and displays data.

Business Logic Layer (BLL) – Contains core logic and rules for data processing.

Data Access Layer (DAL) – Manages data retrieval and storage.

## Technologies Used

C# (Windows Forms/WPF/Console)

.NET Framework/Core

SQL Server (or any preferred database)

Visual Studio

### Features

Separation of concerns for clean, maintainable code.

Business logic independent of UI and data storage.

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Error handling and logging (optional).
